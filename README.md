## OnTheList Assessment - Bobby Ho

[**Live Demo â†’**](https://bug-test-one.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
```
yarn dev
```
Open  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)  with your browser to see the result.<br/><br/>

## Assumptions

1. Assume it is a pagination component<br/><br/>
2. Assume the first button is not only showing the top 10 records, it is showing first 10 records based on page number, so I change the `<Button>first</Button>` to `<Button>previous page</Button>`, so do the `<Button>second</Button>`<br/><br/>
3. Assume the type `MyValue` is a kind of customer data, so I change the type name to `Customer`
