## OnTheList Assessment

[**Live Demo â†’**]()



## Assumptions

1. Assume it is a pagination component
2. Assume the first button is not only showing the top 10 records, it is showing first 10 records based on page number
\(so I change the `<Button>first</Button>` to `<Button>previous page</Button>`, so do the `<Button>second</Button>`)
3. Assume the type `MyValue` is customer data, so I change the type name to `Customer`
